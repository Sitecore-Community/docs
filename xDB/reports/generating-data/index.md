title: Generating Sample Analytics Data
category: xdb

In Sitecore 8, the information you see in reports is not the raw data that was collected in MongoDB. [Analytics data is processed and aggregated](https://doc.sitecore.net/developers/scaling-guide/architecture-overview/experience-platform/processing-architecture.html) into indexes and databases that are then used for reporting. This makes it a bit more difficult to generate data.

## Flow of Information in the xDB

* A contact visits your site and browses around
* On session end, contact and interaction data is flushed to the collection database (MongoDB)
* At regular intervals, that information is **aggregated** and transformed. The aggregated data ends up in two places:
  * The **analytics index**, used primarily but the Experience Profile search page and the List Manager
  * The **reporting SQL database**, used primarily by the Experience Analytics reports
