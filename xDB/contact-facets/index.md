Not to be confused with **goal facets** or **search facets**, a contact facet is a property of a contact - such their first name, e-mail address, or job title. You can easily [add your own facets](https://community.sitecore.net/technical_blogs/b/getting_to_know_sitecore/posts/introducing-contact-facets).

### Configuring Facets

Facets are configured in ``Sitecore.Analytics.Model.config``. There are no corresponding items in Sitecore - it's all done in configuration. The configuration file contains two main sections:

* A list of **elements**. This section maps an interface to a concrete implementation - for instance, the concrete implementation of ``Sitecore.Analytics.Model.Entities.IContactEmailAddresses`` is, by default, ``Sitecore.Analytics.Model.Generated.ContactEmailAddresses``.
* An **entity** definition section that defines the structure of the contact model, including a list of facets and their names. This is the default list:

      <entities>
        <contact>
          <factory type="Sitecore.Analytics.Data.ContactFactory, Sitecore.Analytics" singleInstance="true" />
          <template type="Sitecore.Analytics.Data.ContactTemplateFactory, Sitecore.Analytics" singleInstance="true" />
          <facets>
            <facet name="Personal" contract="Sitecore.Analytics.Model.Entities.IContactPersonalInfo, Sitecore.Analytics.Model" />
            <facet name="Addresses" contract="Sitecore.Analytics.Model.Entities.IContactAddresses, Sitecore.Analytics.Model" />
            <facet name="Emails" contract="Sitecore.Analytics.Model.Entities.IContactEmailAddresses, Sitecore.Analytics.Model" />
            <facet name="Phone Numbers" contract="Sitecore.Analytics.Model.Entities.IContactPhoneNumbers, Sitecore.Analytics.Model" />
            <facet name="Picture" contract="Sitecore.Analytics.Model.Entities.IContactPicture, Sitecore.Analytics.Model" />
            <facet name="Communication Profile" contract="Sitecore.Analytics.Model.Entities.IContactCommunicationProfile, Sitecore.Analytics.Model" />
            <facet name="Preferences" contract="Sitecore.Analytics.Model.Entities.IContactPreferences, Sitecore.Analytics.Model" />
          </facets>
        </contact>
      </entities>

### Retrieving Facets

Once a facet has been set up, you can retrieve it by **name** using the contact API:

	var contact = Tracker.Current.Contact;
	var emailAddresses = contact.GetFacet<IContactEmailAddresses>("Personal");

In this particular case, you will get an IContactEmailAddress object back with a list of email addresses, and the name of the preferred e-mail address (such as work, home, etc):

    public interface IContactEmailAddresses : IFacet, IElement, IValidatable
    {
      IElementDictionary<IEmailAddress> Entries { get; }
    
      string Preferred { get; set; }
    }

### Default Facets

#### Email Address

It is possible to add any number of e-mail addresses to a contact. In MongoDB, the structure for e-mail addresses looks like this per contact:

    "Emails" : {
        "Preferred" : "Home E-Mail",
        "Entries" : {
            "Work E-Mail" : {
                "SmtpAddress" : "toby-work@email.com"
            },
            "Home E-Mail" : {
                "SmtpAddress" : "toby-home@email.com"
            }
        }
    }

When this data is retrieved using the API, each one becomes an ``IEmailAddress`` in the ``Entries`` list, and the **title of the contact's preferred e-mail address* gets mapped to ``Preferred`` - not the e-mail address itself!

    public interface IContactEmailAddresses : IFacet, IElement, IValidatable
    {
      IElementDictionary<IEmailAddress> Entries { get; }

      string Preferred { get; set; }
    }

Each ``IEmailAddress`` has an SmtpAddress, and also a ``BounceCount`` integer where relevant. Note that there is no 'E-Mail Name' anywhere; the ``Entries`` property on ``IContactEmailAddresses`` is a dictionary, and the e-mail names are the keys.

    public interface IEmailAddress : IElement, IValidatable
    {
      string SmtpAddress { get; set; }

      int BounceCount { get; set; }
    }

##### A note about preferred e-mail address

A visitor's preferred e-mail address is the one that is displayed in the Experience Profile search interface - if you do not specify a preference, it will display 'Unknown':

![Create a Sitecore item]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/smtp.PNG)

It also displays in the Experience Profile itself:

![Create a Sitecore item]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/smtp2.PNG)	

All available e-mail addresses are listed (with their keys) in the **Details** tab:

![Create a Sitecore item]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/smtp3.PNG)
