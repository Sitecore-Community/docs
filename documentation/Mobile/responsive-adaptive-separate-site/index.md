# Responsive, adaptive, or separate site

## What can Sitecore do for me when it comes to mobile?

'Mobile' covers a wide variety of topics, from responsive vs adaptive to native mobile apps.  The following is a list of common questions asked on the subject of Sitecore and  mobile:

* What can Sitecore do to help me optimize my website for mobile?
* Can I still do responsive with Sitecore?
* How can I get data out of Sitecore for use with my own mobile apps?
* Can Sitecore help me scale media based on device?

## Responsive, adaptive, or stand-alone site?

You are starting a fresh Sitecore project. One of the requirements is that the website should be easily accessible for mobile users. What are your options?

### Responsive Design

Sitecore is not going to stop you from building a responsive website. From a development point of view, Sitecore is a platform - it only ships with a single, very simple homepage, and no pre-defined 'templates' (like Wordpress does, for example). 

**However**, you may not be taking full advantage of Sitecore's features if you choose to do responsive only:

* Sitecore users can use the Page Editor to modify the **appearance** of a page by adding and removing components to create uniquely designed pages. If you rely 100% on responsive, you have to make sure that these users are savvy enough to know that what they do on their desktop needs to work when the screen shrinks.
* Although Sitecore collects information about the user agent, reporting shows you engagement and traffic based on Sitecore **devices**, that a responsive site does not take advantage of.
* You may not want the same number or type of component - or hierarchy of information, or even the same view of the content - in the mobile view of your site. With Sitecore devices, you can add, remove, or re-order components to better suit a mobile audience.
* You may wish to personalize your content differently based on whether or not they are a mobile user. If your site is responsive only, you would have to set up every single personalization rule to check 'Is this user a mobile user? If so, do X'.

In terms of Information Architecture it's important to consider the effect of this on this site, particularly with field choices. 

* Rich text fields may be required to be more heavily locked down for example as the mobile / tablet browsers may a) not allow as rich a set of features and b) may not be catered for at all.
* Certain fields may well be better presented on mobile using the mobile specific equivalent ( tel: in anchors for example ), this for example might mean you in fact have 2 fields, where for the desktop only site you may only require 1.

Pure Responsive can also present challenges with views / renderings or sublayouts such as the following
* You can possibly end up more complex as you may have to add more classes, wrappers.
* In some cases you may be required to render things in a different order to the order they appear on screen / from Sitecore. This is only really ever an issue if they are coming from repeating content.
* Depending on your front end developers skill, you may find that css specificity can be challenging as in Sitecore we will refrain from using id's where possible due to the dynamic presentation engine. This can present challenges for the front end development.

### Adaptive Design

When we talk about adaptive design in Sitecore, we are talking about **devices**. A device is a way of looking at content - Desktop, print, RSS, mobile, tablet.. you can create any number of devices you want.

An item's presentation details can vary between devices. If you use the [Mobile Device Detection Module](https://marketplace.sitecore.net/Modules/Mobile_Device_Detector.aspx), you can force a visitor's context device to change when they first hit your site (this information is then stored in their session cookie).

This **does not mean that you have to create a completely different set of presentation details**. In reality, most projects use a blend of responsive and adaptive design - for the following reasons:

* I still get all the benefits of responsive - and more. 
* As a content author, I know that I'm designing my page for a particular device - I am more likely to check (in the Mobile Simulator, for example) that my page looks good in that device. 
* I can add/remove/move components and make my mobile pages lighter.
* As a developer, you have the opportunity to **target a particular device** and change Sitecore's behaviour. For example, you might want to make a change to the image rendering pipeline that sets the max image size to 320 for the mobile device - across the site.
* It is less messy to personalize based on device, and you can target each audience separately.
* You will see traffic and engagement reporting per device.

You can, of course, produce completely device-specific presentation for different devices - but that creates a development and management overhead.

In terms of Information Architecture it's less important than responsive design to consider the effect. It can however lead to overly complex templates as you may end up with mobile / tablet specific fields.

### Separate Site

You can, of course, create a completely separate mobile site within Sitecore - this might be the best solution if your mobile content or design has to be drastically different. Sitecore will allow you to point m.mysite.com to a different starting Home node.


### MVC vs Webforms

This is an area that doesn't usually crop up, but is quite important when you consider Sitecore as a mobile delivery mechanism. The Html control from MVC is much greater and the markup it produces is often much smaller ( no viewstate and multiple forms for example ). This makes your front end developers life MUCH simpler and will give potentially a faster and more supportable mobile experience. Whilst responsive IS possible in Webforms, MVC becomes a preferred choice.
